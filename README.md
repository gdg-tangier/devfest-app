## Unity Editor

In this project we used Unity Editor to make it easier to play with 2D and 3D components. Download the Editor at [unity3d.com](https://unity3d.com/unity).

The Unity User Manual helps you learn how to use the Unity Editor and its associated services. You can read it from start to finish, or use it as a reference.

If itâ€™s your first time using Unity, take a look at the introductory documentation on [Working with Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityOverview.html), and see the [Unity Tutorials](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials).

## Compile and Run EasyAR Unity

This [article](http://bit.ly/2BcuJTi) will show you how to open the project and add the key and deploy for the traget platform (Android/iOS).
